# obtained data from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone

# I added a header to start of .data file (no #)
# Sex,Length,Diam,Ht,WWt,SWt,VWt,Shell,Rings

ab <- read.csv("abalone.data",header=T)
library(ggplot2)

# add numeric code for male
ab$Male <- as.integer(ab$Sex == "M")

# for convenience, extracted some columns of interest
dt <- ab[,c(2,5,9,10)]

# used nearest-neighbor method to estimate probability of male at each
# combination of length and whole weight
source("/home/nm/R/kNN.R")
kout <- knn(dt[,c(2,5)],dt[,10],50,regtype="cls")

# added the estimated probabilities to dt
dt$regvals <- kout$regvals

# loaded the GGPlot2 library, a highly popular graphics package for R
library(ggplot2)

# ran scatter plot of weight vs. length, color-coded by estimated
# probability of male
ggplot(dt, aes(dt$Length,dt$WWt,dt$regvals,colour=dt$regvals)) + geom_point(size=1.5)
